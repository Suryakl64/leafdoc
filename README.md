LeafDoc: AI-Powered Plant Disease Diagnostics
Project Overview:
LeafDoc is an intelligent agricultural tool designed to bridge the gap between plant pathology and everyday farming. By leveraging Deep Learning models, the application allows users to upload or capture photos of crop leaves to receive instant, accurate diagnoses of potential diseases and actionable treatment plans.

Problem it Solves:
Farmers often face significant crop losses because they cannot identify plant diseases early or accurately. Access to agricultural experts is often expensive or physically inaccessible in rural areas. LeafDoc provides an immediate, low-cost "digital expert" to prevent spread and improve yields.

Target Users (Personas):
(i)Small-Scale Farmers: Individuals looking for quick, field-side diagnosis of their staple crops without waiting for an expert visit.
(ii)Home Gardeners: Hobbyists who want to maintain healthy indoor or outdoor plants but lack formal botanical knowledge.
(iii)Agricultural Extension Officers: Professionals who can use the tool to quickly document and report disease outbreaks in specific regions.

Vision Statement:
To empower global food security by providing every farmer with the diagnostic tools of a plant pathologist through their smartphone.

Key Features / Goals:
-Instant Image Classification: Analyze leaf images via a CNN model to identify disease.

-Treatment Recommendations: Provide organic and chemical solutions for identified issues.

-Offline Support: Allow users to capture photos in remote areas and process them when back in range.

-Historical Tracking: A log of past scans to monitor plant health over time.

Success Metrics:
-Accuracy: Achieve a minimum of 92% classification accuracy across the primary dataset.

-User Retention: 40% of users returning to the app for more than one growing season.

-Speed: Diagnostic results delivered in under 3 seconds.

Assumptions & Constraints:
-Assumptions: Users have access to a smartphone with a functional camera; a dataset of labeled plant diseases is available for training.

-Constraints: High-resolution images are required for accuracy; the current model may be limited to specific crop types (e.g., Tomato, Potato, Pepper).
